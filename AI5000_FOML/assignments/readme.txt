For Ques 1:

> Open folder named "Ans 1". It contains a "ans 01.ipynb' file that has all the code. 
> Data input is in the file mess_data. It has 5 columns:
	. Day(string)- names of the weekdays 
	. Holiday(binary) - binary variable 1 if its a holiday otherwise 0.
	. Time_In(int) - the time when I entered in mess (example number 1722 represents time 17:22)
	. Time_out(int) - time when I exited from mess
	. Time_taken(int) - total time taken (in minutes) to finish the food

> To run the code:
	Open jupyter notebook using command prompt within the same folder where mess_data file exists. Otherwise, change the path while reading csv file accordingly.
